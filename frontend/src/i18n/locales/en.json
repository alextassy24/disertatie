				"Title": "Phase 2 - Testing Components and Their Compatibility",
				"Description": "During the component testing phase, the following conclusions were reached:",
				"Paragraphs": {
					"P1": "The GSM module is malfunctioning, unable to establish a connection with the network, despite multiple power supply methods (3.7V batteries, direct from the board) and various connection methods (breadboard, pins, cables). Therefore, it was decided to replace it with an improved one;",
					"P2": "The GPS module is quite picky when connecting to satellites, sometimes requiring more time to establish a connection. Factors such as weather and surroundings greatly affect the connection process."
				}
			},
			"Phase3": {
				"Title": "Phase 3 - Replacing Inadequate Components",
				"Description": "",
				"Paragraphs": {
					"P1": "The SIM800L GSM module was replaced with a SIM800L 2.0 GSM module, which comes with a more efficient antenna compared to the helical one of the previous module;",
					"P2": "The Arduino UNO R3 board was replaced with an Arduino Nano V3 board due to its smaller size."
				}
			},
			"Phase4": {
				"Title": "Phase 4 - Testing Replaced Components",
				"Description": "",
				"Paragraphs": {
					"P1": "The Arduino Nano V3 board fails to deliver sufficient voltage at the 5V pin, with the actual transmitted value being approximately 3.9V, and at the moment of connection with the GPS module, the input voltage is 2.46V, which is insufficient to operate the module properly;",
					"P2": "Due to the replacement of the GSM module and the insufficient voltage provided by the Arduino Nano V3 board, it is necessary to revert to the Arduino Uno R3 board, as we know that the GPS module works with this board, and the new GSM module requires a 5V voltage to operate."

	"faq": {
		"Title": "Frequently asked questions",
		"Q1": "What are the key features of the monitoring device device?",
		"A1": "The monitoring device device offers various features: Real-time health monitoring, including heart rate, blood pressure, and activity tracking. Emergency SOS function for immediate assistance. Sleep tracking and analysis for better sleep management. Waterproof and durable design for everyday use. Long battery life to ensure continuous monitoring without frequent charging.",
		"Q2": "What functionalities does the web app platform provide for users of the monitoring device device?",
		"A2": "The web app platform acts as a comprehensive dashboard for users: Displays detailed health metrics recorded by the device in an easily accessible format. Allows users to set health goals and track progress over time. Provides personalized insights and recommendations based on the gathered data. Enables data sharing with healthcare professionals or family members for remote monitoring and support.",
		"Q3": "How is the privacy and security of user data ensured on the web app platform?",
		"A3": "The web app platform prioritizes user data privacy and security: Implements end-to-end encryption to safeguard sensitive health information. Adheres to strict industry standards and regulations (such as HIPAA or GDPR) for data protection. Requires secure authentication methods (like two-factor authentication) to access user accounts. Regularly undergoes security audits and updates to address potential vulnerabilities and ensure robust protection against unauthorized access or data breaches."
